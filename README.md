A package to perform refinement of MD simulation trajectories. Documentation can be browsed at [this page](https://bussilab.github.io/doc-MDRefine/)

To install package and dependencies with pip (version from PyPI):

```
pip install MDRefine
```

You can install the development version by cloning the repository and, from its root directory, type:

```
pip install -e .
```

In case you prefer to install MDRefine in a separate environment to avoid polluting your Python installation with unnecessary packages, we recommend using a Python virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install MDRefine
```

To load this environment in a new shell, type `source /path/to/env/bin/activate`.

We suggest to run the tutorials in the `Examples` folder to have some meaningful insights on how to use `MDRefine` in its main application cases (refinements of the ensembles, the force field and/or the forward models).
