---

A package to perform refinement of MD simulation trajectories.  
üìö **Documentation** is available at the [project page](https://bussilab.github.io/doc-MDRefine/).

---

## üöÄ Installation

To install the package and dependencies from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/MDRefine/):

```bash
pip install MDRefine
```

To install the **development version** from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/bussilab/MDRefine.git
cd MDRefine
pip install -e .
```

We recommend installing in a dedicated environment to avoid polluting your base Python setup:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install MDRefine
```

To activate this environment in a new terminal:

```
source /path/to/env/bin/activate
```

## üìò Getting Started

We suggest running the tutorials in the [`Examples/`](./Examples) folder to gain insights into MDRefine's usage for:

- Refinement of molecular ensembles  
- Force field correction  
- Forward model optimization  

The `Examples/` include Jupyter notebooks and scripts demonstrating practical workflows.

## üß™ Continuous Integration

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/bussilab/MDRefine/actions) for automatic testing across Python versions and operating systems.  
CI runs are skipped for documentation-only commits (e.g., `README.md` changes).
